## Question 1


### Question 1a

For a DataFrame `d`, you can add a column with `d['new column name'] = ...` and assign a list or array of values to the column. Add a column of integers containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 called `rank1` to the `fruit_info` table which expresses your personal preference about the taste ordering for each fruit (1 is tastiest; 4 is least tasty).

### Question 1b

You can also add a column to `d` with `d.loc[:, 'new column name'] = ...`. As discussed in lecture, the first parameter is for the rows and second is for columns. The `:` means change all rows and the `new column name` indicates the column you are modifying (or in this case, adding).

Add a column called `rank2` to the `fruit_info` table which contains the same values in the same order as the `rank1` column.

```python
fruit_info.loc[:,'rank2'] = fruit_info['rank1']
fruit_info
```

## Question 2

Use the `.drop()` method to [drop](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) both the `rank1` and `rank2` columns you created. (Make sure to use the `axis` parameter correctly.) Note that `drop` does not change a table, but instead returns a new table with fewer columns or rows unless you set the optional `inplace` parameter.

*Hint*: Look through the documentation to see how you can drop multiple columns of a Pandas dataframe at once using a list of column names.

```python
fruit_info_original = fruit_info.drop(['rank1','rank2'],axis=1)
fruit_info_original
```

## Question 3

Use the `.rename()` method to [rename](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html) the columns of `fruit_info_original` so they begin with capital letters. Set this new dataframe to `fruit_info_caps`.

```python
fruit_info_caps = fruit_info_original.rename(columns=str.capitalize)
fruit_info_caps
```

## Question 4

[dataset](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/state/namesbystate.zip)

Selecting multiple columns is easy.  You just need to supply a list of column names.  Select the `Name` and `Year` **in that order** from the `baby_names` table.

```python
name_and_year = baby_names[['Name','Year']]
name_and_year[:5]
```

## Question 5
Using a boolean array, select the names in Year 2000 (from `baby_names`) that have larger than 3000 counts. Keep all columns from the original `baby_names` dataframe.

Note: Any time you use `p & q` to filter the dataframe, make sure to use `df[(df[p]) & (df[q])]` or `df.loc[(df[p]) & (df[q])]`. That is, make sure to wrap conditions with parentheses.

**Remember** that both slicing and `loc` will achieve the same result, it is just that `loc` is typically faster in production. You are free to use whichever one you would like.

```python
result = baby_names[(baby_names['Year']==2000)&(baby_names['Count']>3000)]
result.head()
```

Optionally, repeat the exercise from above, but this time using the `query` command from lecture.

```python
result_using_query = baby_names.query('Year==2000&Count>3000')
result_using_query.head()
```

## Question 6

Some names gain/lose popularity because of cultural phenomena such as a political figure coming to power. Below, we plot the popularity of the female name Hillary in Calfiornia over time. What do you notice about this plot? What might be the cause of the steep drop?

```python
hillary_baby_name = baby_names[(baby_names['Name'] == 'Hillary') & (baby_names['State'] == 'CA') & (baby_names['Sex'] == 'F')]
plt.plot(hillary_baby_name['Year'], hillary_baby_name['Count'])
plt.title("Hillary Popularity Over Time")
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

## Question 1

[dataset](http://www.ds100.org/fa20/resources/assets/datasets/lab04_data_fa20.zip)

### Question 1a

Above, it seems like `OFFENSE` is more specific than `CVLEGEND`, e.g. "LARCENY" vs. "THEFT FELONY (OVER $950)". If you're unfamiliar with the term, "larceny" is a legal term for theft of personal property.

To get a sense of how many subcategories there are for each `OFFENSE`, set `calls_by_cvlegend_and_offense` equal to a multi-indexed series where the data is first indexed on the `CVLEGEND` and then on the `OFFENSE`, and the data is equal to the number of offenses in the database that match the respective `CVLEGEND` and `OFFENSE`. For example, calls_by_cvlegend_and_offense["LARCENY", "THEFT FROM PERSON"] should return 24.

```python

calls_by_cvlegend_and_offense = calls[['CVLEGEND','OFFENSE']].value_counts()
calls_by_cvlegend_and_offense["LARCENY", "THEFT FROM PERSON"]
```

```bash
24
```

### Question 1b

In the cell below, set `answer1b` equal to a list of strings corresponding to the possible values for `OFFENSE` when `CVLEGEND` is "LARCENY". You can type the answer manually, or you can create an expression that automatically extracts the names.

```python
answer1b = (
    calls_by_cvlegend_and_offense.loc[
        calls_by_cvlegend_and_offense.index.get_level_values("CVLEGEND") == "LARCENY"
    ]
    .index.get_level_values("OFFENSE")
    .tolist()
)
answer1b

```

```bash
['THEFT MISD. (UNDER $950)', 'THEFT FELONY (OVER $950)', 'THEFT FROM PERSON']
```

## Question 2

What are the five crime types of CVLEGEND that have the most crime events? You may need to use `value_counts` to find the answer.
Save your results into `answer2` as a list of strings.

**Hint:** *The `keys` method of the Series class might be useful.*

```python
answer2 = calls['CVLEGEND'].value_counts().head().keys().tolist()
```

## Question 3

Now it is your turn to make some plots using `pandas`.  Let's start by transforming the data so that it is easier to work with. We then will look at some distributions of the data.

The CVDOW field isn't named helpfully and it is hard to see the meaning from the data alone. According to the website linked at the top of this notebook, CVDOW is actually indicating the day that events happened. 0->Sunday, 1->Monday ... 6->Saturday.

### Question 3a

Add a new column `Day` into the `calls` dataframe that has the string weekday (eg. 'Sunday') for the corresponding value in CVDOW. For example, if the first 3 values of `CVDOW` are `[3, 6, 0]`, then the first 3 values of the `Day` column should be `["Wednesday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]`.

**Hint:** *Try using the [Series.map](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.map.html) function on `calls["CVDOW"]`.  Can you assign this to the new column `calls["Day"]`?*

```python
days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
day_indices = range(7)
indices_to_days_dict = dict(zip(day_indices, days)) # Should look like {0:"Sunday", 1:"Monday", ..., 6:"Saturday"}

calls['Day'] = calls['CVDOW'].map(indices_to_days_dict)
```

### Question 3b

Now let's look at the EVENTTM column which indicates the time for events. Since it contains hour and minute information, let's extract the hour info and create a new column named `Hour` in the `calls` dataframe. You should save the hour as an `int`.

**Hint:** *Your code should only require one line*

```python
calls['Hour'] = pd.to_datetime(calls['EVENTTM']).dt.hour
```

### Question 3c

Using `pandas`, construct a vertical bar plot with the count of the number of calls (entries in the table) for each day of the week **ordered by the day of the week** (eg. `Sunday`, `Monday`, ...). Be sure that your axes are labeled and that your plot is titled.  There should be approximately 500 calls per day.

**Hint:** *Given a series `s`, and an array `coolIndex` that has the same entries as in `s.index`, `s[coolIndex]` will return a copy of the series in the same order as `coolIndex`.*

```python
order_day = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday']
data = calls['Day'].value_counts()[order_day]
ax = data.plot(kind='bar')
ax.set_ylabel("The day of the week")
ax.set_xlabel("Number of Calls")
ax.set_title("Number of Calls By Day of the Week");
# Leave this for grading purposes
ax_3c = plt.gca()
```

### Question 3d

Using `pandas`, construct a line plot with the count of the number of calls (entries in the table) for each hour of the day  **ordered by the time** (eg. `12:00 AM`, `1:00 AM`, ...). Please use the provided variable `hours` in your answer. Be sure that your axes are labeled and that your plot is titled. 

```python
hours = list(range(24))
data = calls['Hour'].value_counts()[hours]
ax = data.plot(kind='line')
ax.set_xlabel("The time")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Calls")
ax.set_title("Number of Calls By the time")

# Leave this for grading purposes
ax_3d = plt.gca()
```

## Question 4

It seems weekdays generally have slightly more calls than Saturday or Sunday, but the difference does not look significant.  

We can break down into some particular types of events to see their distribution. For example, let's make a bar plot for the CVLEGEND "ROBBERY". Which day is the peak for "ROBBERY"?

### Question 4a

Use `pandas` to create a vertical bar plot of the number of total robberies reported on each day of the week, again ordered by the days of the week starting with Sunday. Please use the provided variable `filtered` in your answer.

**Hint:** *This should be very similar to Question 3b*

```python
filtered = calls[calls["CVLEGEND"] == "ROBBERY"]

order_day = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday']
data = filtered['Day'].value_counts()[order_day]
ax = data.plot(kind='bar')
ax.set_ylabel("The day of the week")
ax.set_xlabel("Number of Robberies")
ax.set_title("Number of Robberies By Day of the Week");

# Leave this for grading purposes
ax_4a = plt.gca()
```

## Question 5

In the cell below, generate a boxplot which examines the hour of day of each crime broken down by the `CVLEGEND` value.  To construct this plot use the [DataFrame.boxplot](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.boxplot.html) documentation. You may want to rotate the `CVLEGEND` labels for better readability.

### Looking at your plot, which crime type appears to have the largest interquartile range? Put your results into `answer5` as a string

```python
calls.boxplot(column='Hour',by='CVLEGEND',rot=90)
answer5 = 'SEX CRIME'
```

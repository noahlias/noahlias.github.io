## Question 1

For this question we will use SQL to extract data out of the `indiv_sample_nyc` table. The schema for this table is given below.

### Question 1a

Let's start by looking at 2016 election contributions made by Donald Trump, who was a NY resident during that year. Write a SQL statement that will return the cmte_id, transaction_amt, and name for every contribution made by any donor with "DONALD" and "TRUMP" in their name.

Hint: You'll need to use `WHERE name LIKE '%TRUMP%' AND name LIKE '%DONALD%'`.

```python
query_q1a='''
SELECT
    cmte_id,
    transaction_amt,
    name
FROM indiv_sample_nyc
WHERE name like '%TRUMP%' and name like '%DONALD%'
'''
res_q1a = pd.read_sql(query_q1a, engine)
res_q1a
```

### Question 1b

If we look at the list above, it appears that some donations were not by Donald Trump himself, but instead by an entity called "DONALD J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT INC". If we look at the list of donors, we see that our query only seems to have picked up one such anomalous name.

```python
query_q1b = '''
SELECT
    cmte_id,
    transaction_amt,
    name
FROM indiv_sample_nyc
WHERE name not like '%DONALD J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT INC%' and name like '%TRUMP%' and name like '%DONALD%'
'''
res_q1b = pd.read_sql(query_q1b, engine)
res_q1b

```

### Question 1c

As a review of some of the key ideas from CS61A/CS88, let's refine our query above.

We see that many of the contributions above were to the same committee. Create a new SQL query that returns the total amount that Donald Trump contributed to each committee. Your table should have three columns `cmte_id`, `total_amount`, and `num_donations`, where `total_amount` is the total amount contributed to that committee, and `num_donations` is the total number of donations. Your table should be sorted in decreased order of `total_amount`.

Hint: Use `GROUP BY` as covered in CS61A and CS88.

Hint: Use `COUNT(*)` as covered in CS61A and CS88.

Hint: Use `SUM()` as covered in CS61A and CS88.

Hint: Use `ORDER BY` as covered in CS61A and CS88.

Hint: Use `DESC` as covered in CS61A and CS88.

Hint: Your `WHERE` clause should be the same as question 1b.


```python
query_q1c = '''
SELECT
    cmte_id,
    sum(transaction_amt) as total_amount,
    count(*) as num_donations
FROM indiv_sample_nyc
WHERE name not like '%DONALD J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT INC%' and name like '%TRUMP%' and name like '%DONALD%'
group by cmte_id
order by total_amount desc
'''
res_q1c = pd.read_sql(query_q1c, engine)
res_q1c

```

### Question 1d

Now we'd like to know the name of each committee, i.e. we want to know the name of the identity that Donald Trump was making contributions to. Modify your query from question 1c so that it also shows the name of each committee. That is, your table should have four columns `cmte_id`, `total_amount`, `num_donations`, and `cmte_nm`.

The names of the committees are given in the `cmte_nm` column of the `comm` table.

Hint: You'll need to join the `indiv_sample_nyc` and `comm` tables.

Hint: One approach is a nested select statement (a.k.a. subquery) as discussed in lecture.

```python

query_q1d = '''
select a.cmte_id, a.total_amount,a.num_donations,b.cmte_nm
from (SELECT
    cmte_id,
    sum(transaction_amt) as total_amount,
    count(*) as num_donations
FROM indiv_sample_nyc
WHERE name not like '%DONALD J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT INC%' and name like '%TRUMP%' and name like '%DONALD%'
group by cmte_id
order by total_amount desc) a
left join comm b on a.cmte_id = b.cmte_id
'''
res_q1d = pd.read_sql(query_q1d, engine)
res_q1d
```

## Question 2

### Question 2a

Let's select transactions in the `indiv_sample_nyc` table with a `cmte_id` (committee id) that ends in 5. Then, groupby the transactions in the `indiv_sample_nyc` table with the `cmte_id` column, and count how many transactions and how much total amount of contribution there are for each `cmte_id`. Select the top 5 committees ordered by the transaction count.

Your output should look similar to:

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>committee_id</th>
      <th>total_amount</th>
      <th>count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>C00575795</td>
      <td>25099091</td>
      <td>110657</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>C00000935</td>
      <td>6989835</td>
      <td>36237</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>C00035675</td>
      <td>316019</td>
      <td>3417</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>C00040535</td>
      <td>492567</td>
      <td>3277</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>C00012245</td>
      <td>499659</td>
      <td>2128</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

SELECT
    cmte_id AS committee_id,
    sum(transaction_amt) AS total_amount,
    count(*) AS count

where cmte_id like '%5'
group by cmte_id
order by count(*) desc limit 5
'''
res_q2a = pd.read_sql(query_q2a, engine)
res_q2a
```

### Question 2b

When you printed the schema for the tables, you may have noticed that both the `cand` and `comm` tables have a `cand_id` column. Let's try joining these two tables on this column.

List the first 5 candidate names (`cand_name`) in reverse lexicographic order by `cand_name`, along with their corresponding committee names. Only select rows that have a matching `cand_id` in both tables.

Your output should look similar to:

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>cand_name</th>
      <th>cmte_nm</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>ZUTLER, DANIEL PAUL MR</td>
      <td>CITIZENS TO ELECT DANIEL P ZUTLER FOR PRESIDENT</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>ZUMWALT, JAMES</td>
      <td>ZUMWALT FOR CONGRESS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>ZUKOWSKI, ANDREW GEORGE</td>
      <td>ZUKOWSKI FOR CONGRESS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>ZUCCOLO, JOE</td>
      <td>JOE ZUCCOLO FOR CONGRESS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>ZORN, ROBERT ERWIN</td>
      <td>CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

order by  c1.cand_name desc limit 5
'''
res_q2b = pd.read_sql(query_q2b, engine)
res_q2b
```

### Question 2c

As in the previous part, list the first 5 candidate names (`cand_name`) by reverse lexicographic order and their corresponding committee names (`cmte_nm`). This time, include all candidate names. If there is no matching `cand_id` in the `comm` table, then `cmte_nm` should be NULL.

Your output should look similar to:

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>cand_name</th>

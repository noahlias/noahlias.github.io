Description It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.
Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

Let $d_1$ be the 1st digit, $d_2$ be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following: $d_2d_3d_4=406$ is divisible by 2 $d_3d_4d_5=063$ is divisible by 3</description></item><item><title>Pandigital products</title><link>https://noahlias.github.io/post/euler_32/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 13:31:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://noahlias.github.io/post/euler_32/</guid><description>Problem 32 Description We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

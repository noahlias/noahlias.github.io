For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime. What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3) The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3,</description></item><item><title>Counting Sundays</title><link>https://noahlias.github.io/post/euler_19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 14:45:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://noahlias.github.io/post/euler_19/</guid><description>Problem 19 Description You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself. 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
